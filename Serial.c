/*
    The UART HAL driver can be used as follows:
    
    (#) Declare a UART_HandleTypeDef handle structure.
  
    (#) Initialize the UART low level resources by implementing the HAL_UART_MspInit() API:
        (##) Enable the USARTx interface clock.
        (##) UART pins configuration:
            (+++) Enable the clock for the UART GPIOs.
            (+++) Configure these UART pins as alternate function pull-up.
        (##) NVIC configuration if you need to use interrupt process (HAL_UART_Transmit_IT()
             and HAL_UART_Receive_IT() APIs):
            (+++) Configure the USARTx interrupt priority.
            (+++) Enable the NVIC USART IRQ handle.
        (##) DMA Configuration if you need to use DMA process (HAL_UART_Transmit_DMA()
             and HAL_UART_Receive_DMA() APIs):
            (+++) Declare a DMA handle structure for the Tx/Rx stream.
            (+++) Enable the DMAx interface clock.
            (+++) Configure the declared DMA handle structure with the required 
                  Tx/Rx parameters.                
            (+++) Configure the DMA Tx/Rx Stream.
            (+++) Associate the initialized DMA handle to the UART DMA Tx/Rx handle.
            (+++) Configure the priority and enable the NVIC for the transfer complete 
                  interrupt on the DMA Tx/Rx Stream.

    (#) Program the Baud Rate, Word Length, Stop Bit, Parity, Hardware 
        flow control and Mode(Receiver/Transmitter) in the Init structure.

    (#) For the UART asynchronous mode, initialize the UART registers by calling
        the HAL_UART_Init() API.
    
    (#) For the UART Half duplex mode, initialize the UART registers by calling 
        the HAL_HalfDuplex_Init() API.
    
    (#) For the LIN mode, initialize the UART registers by calling the HAL_LIN_Init() API.
    
    (#) For the Multi-Processor mode, initialize the UART registers by calling 
        the HAL_MultiProcessor_Init() API.
        
     [..] 
       (@) The specific UART interrupts (Transmission complete interrupt, 
            RXNE interrupt and Error Interrupts) will be managed using the macros
            __HAL_UART_ENABLE_IT() and __HAL_UART_DISABLE_IT() inside the transmit 
            and receive process.
          
     [..] 
       (@) These APIs (HAL_UART_Init() and HAL_HalfDuplex_Init()) configure also the 
            low level Hardware GPIO, CLOCK, CORTEX...etc) by calling the customized 
            HAL_UART_MspInit() API.
